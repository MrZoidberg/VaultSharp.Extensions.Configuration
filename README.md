# VaultSharp.Extensions.Configuration

[![GitHub Actions Status](https://github.com/MrZoidberg/VaultSharp.Extensions.Configuration/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/MrZoidberg/VaultSharp.Extensions.Configuration/actions) ![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/VaultSharp.Extensions.Configuration)

VaultSharp.Extensions.Configuration is an extension to [VaultSharp](https://github.com/rajanadar/VaultSharp) that allows reading configuration options from Vault.

VaultSharp.Extensions.Configuration is a .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET 6.0 based cross-platform C# Library.

## Get Started

VaultSharp.Extensions.Configuration can be installed using the Nuget package manager or the dotnet CLI.

`dotnet add package VaultSharp.Extensions.Configuration`

It can be injected as a [IConfigurationProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.iconfigurationprovider?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1)
to load configuration from HashiCorp Vault:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
        {
            config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
                .AddVaultConfiguration(() => new VaultOptions("http://localhost:8200", "root"), "sampleapp", "secret");
        })
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
        });
```

The `AddVaultConfiguration` method accepts several parameters:

1. Function to provide VaultOptions with Vault connection configuration (optional).

2. Application alias in Vault data. It's used a part of the path to read secrets.

3. Mount point of KV secrets. The default value is `secret` (optional).

## Monitoring for changes

You can enable monitoring of changes in Vault data and automatic reload by setting `VaultOptions.ReloadOnChange` to `true`.
The default check interval is 5 minutes, but can be configured.
Data is checked using version information from key metadata.

```csharp
config.AddVaultConfiguration(
        () => new VaultOptions(
            "htpp://localhost:8200",
            "root",
            reloadOnChange: true,
            reloadCheckIntervalSeconds: 60),
        "sampleapp",
        "secret");
```

Also you would need to register hosted services `VaultChangeWatcher` in your `Startup.cs` that will check Vault data for updates:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
    services.AddHostedService<VaultChangeWatcher>();
}
```

Later in your services you can track changes in app configuration using `IOptionsSnapshot` or `IOptionsMonitor`.
Keep in mind that your service should be registered as scoped or transient to receive updates.
Also `IOptionsSnapshot` can return empty value in some cases ([it's .net core bug](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37860))

## Configuration using additional characters for a configuration path

This will be helpful when you want to flatten the structure of the secrets.
For example the following two secret objects will evaluate to the same configuration if for the second object the `additionalCharactersForConfigurationPath` option is used with `new []{'.'}` value:

```json
{
    "secrets":
    {
        "DB": 
        {
            "ConnectionString": "secret value"
        }
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "secrets":
    {
        "DB.ConnectionString": "secret value" 
    }
}
```

```csharp
config.AddVaultConfiguration(
        () => new VaultOptions(
            "htpp://localhost:8200",
            "root",
            additionalCharactersForConfigurationPath: new []{'.'}),),
        "sampleapp",
        "secret");
```
new VaultOptions("http://localhost:8200", "root", null, null, false, 300, false, new []{'.'}),
## Configuration using environmnt variables

Alternatively, you can configure Vault connection using next environmnt variables:

- `VAULT_ADDR` : Address of the Vault instance. Default value is `"http://locahost:8200`.
- `VAULT_TOKEN` : Vault token. Used for token-based authentication. Default value is `root`.
- `VAULT_ROLEID` : Vault AppRole ID. Used for AppRole-based authentication.
- `VAULT_SECRET` : Vault AppRole secret. Used for AppRole-based authentication.

## Preparing secrets in Vault

You need to store your secrets with special naming rules.
First of all, all secrets should use KV2 storage and have prefix `{app_alias}` or `{app_alias}/{env}`.

For example, if your app has alias `sampleapp` and environment `producton` and you want to have configuration option `ConnectionString` your secret path would be or `sampleapp` or `sampleapp/producton`.

All parameters are grouped and arranged in folders and can be managed within the group. All secret data should use JSON format with secret data inside:

```json
{
    "ConnectionString": "secret value",
    "Option1": "secret value 2",
}
```

### Nested secrets

There are two ways to create nested parameters.

1. Description of nesting directly in Json format (preferred approach):

```json
{
    "DB": 
    {
        "ConnectionString": "secret value"
    }
}
```

1. Creating a parameter on the desired path "sampleapp/producton/DB":

```json
{
    "ConnectionString": "secret value"
}
```

## Limitations

- Currently, only token and AppRole based authentication is supported.
- TTL of the secrets is not controlled.

## Contributing

Before starting work on a pull request, I suggest commenting on, or raising, an issue on the issue tracker so that we can help and coordinate efforts.

To run tests locally you need to have Docker running and have Vault's default port 8200 free.
